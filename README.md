Pewlett-Hackard is concerned by the number of employees that are coming eligble for retirement and the gap their retirment will leave in the workforce. The purpose of this analysis is to verify the number of employees retiring and who would be able to be a mentor.

# Results

* A total of 133,776 job titles were returned on a queary for those eligable to retire. 
* On the unique titles query, it returned 90,398 that gave a more accurate reading of job positions held by the retirees. 
* From the retiring titles queary we learned that the largest number of retirees are holding a Senior Engineer title. 
* Out of the 90K only about 1,464 were eligible to participate in the mentorship program.

# Summary

Overall, there are a lot of retirees in the upcoming years.  I think the mentorship program should work quickly and find a way to train as many people as they can to fill the upcoming gap.
